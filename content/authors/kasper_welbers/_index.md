Kasper Welbers is an assistant professor at the Department of Communication Science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. His research focuses primarily on how the gatekeeping process of news messages has changed due to the proliferation of new media technologies, and how we can study these using computational methods.

Initially, this mainly involved automatic content analysis of news messages, but in today's high-choice media environment merely looking at the supply of news tells us little about how news gets around. Currently, he is investigating data donation approaches for obtaining digital traces of news consumption choices to study gatekeeping as an interaction between the gatekeepers and the gated.

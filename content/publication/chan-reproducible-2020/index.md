abstract: With global media content databases and online content being available,
  analyzing topical structures in different languages simultaneously has become an
  urgent computational task. Some previous studies have analyzed topics in a multilingual
  corpus by translating all items into a single language using a machine translation
  service, such as Google Translate. We argue that this method is not reproducible
  in the long run and proposes a new method â€“ Reproducible Extraction of Cross-lingual
  Topics Using R (rectr). Our method utilizes open-source-aligned word embeddings
  to understand the cross-lingual meanings of words and has a mechanism to normalize
  residual influence from language differences. We present a benchmark that compares
  the topics extracted from a corpus of English, German, and French news using our
  method with methods used in the literature. We show that our method is not only
  reproducible but can also generate high-quality cross-lingual topics. We demonstrate
  how our method can be applied in tracking news topics across time and languages.

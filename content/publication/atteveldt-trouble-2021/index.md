abstract: Open science and effective collaboration both require the sharing of data
  between researchers. This is especially true for computational methods, as the technical
  complexity and heterogeneous data sources often require collaboration between researchers
  in different institutions and jurisdictions. Many data sources, however, cannot
  be shared openly because of copyright law and contracts such as terms of service.
  These regulations can be complex, sometimes untested in case law, and vary between
  countries and over time. This paper details our experiences in conducting international
  comparative research on very large collections of news items from multiple countries.
  We set out the main problems we have encountered and some short- term approaches
  we have used to mitigate some of these problems. We end with listing some additional
  long-term actions that will advance our research communityâ€™s ability to collaborate
  on computational research using sensitive data.
